                    <br>
                    <p>
                        My name is Andy Li, and I’m a Grade 11 student at Greenwood College School with a strong focus on STEM—especially engineering. I have a deep interest in computer science and mathematics, and over the years, I've completed several small projects, including websites and games.
                    </p>
                    <p>At school, I’m actively involved in a range of clubs and committees, including the Computer Science Club (soon to become the Hack Club), the rock climbing club, the Car Club, the Musical Dynamics Club (which I founded), the Asian Affinity Group, and the newspaper committee.</p>
                    <p>Beyond academics, I enjoy expanding my programming knowledge, playing games like Minecraft and Nier: Automata, and listening to gufeng music, a style rooted in traditional Chinese sounds. I also play the violin in my spare time.</p>
                    <p>I’ve received multiple nominations for academic achievement, musical performance, and character, and I’ve participated in several CEMC math contests, occasionally earning medal nominations. In athletics, I’ve been a member of the school swim team for three years and have competed in CISAA swim meets.</p>
                    <p>While it’s difficult to fully describe myself, my science teacher captured it well in a recent recommendation letter: I’m “a humble, capable, and humorous individual. Andy is an exceptional student whose combination of creativity, eagerness to learn, humor, and determination make him a valuable member of any community he joins.”</p>

            <br>
            <h2>There are three factors I would consider when selecting a postsecondary institution:</h2>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li><span style="color:red; font-size:20px">Academic Reliability</span><br> I would only consider going to universities that are strong in their field and have a great international reputation. Universities like York University or Windsor University are not on my list since they are in the middle lane of Canadian universities, not to mention globally. Universities like U of T or Uwaterloo are my goal since they provide way more educational opportunities and once I graduate it is way easier to get a job with their degree. Job opportunities after graduation are really important to me as Canada’s economy is not looking good and nobody knows what’s going to happen in the future. At least having a great university degree is going to provide me with some comfort. Also, I have a lot of life goals, more than 20, and most of them need a type of fuel called money to support them, so I would definitely not give up on my life goals and search for good universities that would lead me to success.</li>
                <br>
                <li><span style="color:red; font-size:20px">Distance from Home</span><br>Universities like UBC have a global reputation, and they are strong in their academics, but it’s more than 4000 km from Toronto, and that’s too far from home for me. I am the only one who speaks English in my family, so if something happens, I am not going to be able to deal with it 4000 km away from home. I also have to see my family once in a while; staying away from them for a whole semester is going to be really challenging for me. Being too far from home would also mean less time spent with family, and that is not something I want, due to the fact that humans only live for some 70-80 years on average. </li>
                <br>
                <li><span style="color:red; font-size:20px">Outside-of-school programs</span><br> I want to go to a university that provides a lot of opportunities that allow students to explore beyond the classroom, especially ones that help with experiences and resumes. I want to have fun in those activities while also gaining meaningful experiences that will benefit my future application in a variety of fields. Universities like UWaterloo provide co-op programs that allow students to work while also studying. After graduation, most students with a co-op will already have 2 years of experience on their resume, which makes them easier to find a job. These activities not only enrich my knowledge but also my personality and social life, which are essential for every human being.</li>

    <!-- Health and Well Being -->

            <h1 class="sub-title">Health and Well Being</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Taking care of both my physical and mental health has become an important priority for me, especially during the demanding years of high school. Balancing academics, extracurriculars, and personal responsibilities can be overwhelming at times, so I’ve made it a goal to be more intentional about how I manage my health and well-being. In this section, I will share how I maintain physical activity, manage stress, and reflect on the strategies that help me stay balanced and motivated. I continue to learn how to take better care of myself both mentally and physically.</p>
            <br>
            <p>To maintain my physical health, I occasionally go to the gym for workouts. I’ve noticed that without regular exercise, I tend to get tired quickly during physical activities, so going to the gym helps me build endurance. I was also an active member of the competitive swimming team from Grades 9 to 11. Swimming was a great way to stay fit, and I appreciated that it was less exhausting compared to high-intensity sports like basketball or soccer, yet still effective in keeping me active.</p>
            <br>
            <img src="images/swim.jpg" alt="Swimming" class="award-image">
            <br>
            <p>For my mental health, I believe I’m currently in a good place. I maintain my well-being by following a routine that keeps me grounded—eating well, sleeping regularly, playing games, coding, and reading. These activities help me relax, recharge, and stay mentally engaged.</p>
            <br>
            <img src="images/code.png" alt="Code" class="award-image">
            <br>
            <p>When I encounter stressful situations, I try to face them head-on and solve problems as they arise. Most of the time, I find that if I put in the effort, I can work through them. However, certain stresses—like pressure from academics, responsibilities in clubs and committees, or even helping my family with things like taxes due to language barriers—can be harder to manage. These challenges require more time and patience. My strategy is to continue improving myself—whether it’s through gaining new skills or becoming more efficient—so that in the future, I’ll be more prepared to handle these situations with confidence.</p>
