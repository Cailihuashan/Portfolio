                <img src="images/image.png" alt="Civic Character" class="award-image">
                <p>So far, I have completed a variety of community service experiences, including helping out at TDSB schools such as Davisville Public School, and volunteering at city events like the Toronto Santa Claus Parade. I also took part in school-based service as a CISAA swim meet emergency exit supervisor. These opportunities helped me develop responsibility and situational awareness. Outside of formal volunteering, I also support my family by regularly helping my mom with household chores such as throwing out the trash, cleaning, washing dishes, and translating. Looking ahead, I hope to get involved in service projects aligned with my academic interests. For example, I would be excited to volunteer in university science labs or research settings that connect to my major. I believe this will allow me to give back in a way that also deepens my learning.</p>
                <p>This year, I took on a leadership role by founding and hosting the Musical Dynamics Club. The goal of the club is to bring together rhythm game enthusiasts and encourage discussions about music and gameplay mechanics. With a steady group of four to six members, I’ve worked to make sure that our meetings are inclusive and engaging. I focused on listening to members' input and making decisions that reflected their interests, which helped build trust and consistency. In addition to this school-based leadership, I also show initiative at home by stepping in when needed without being asked—like helping manage family responsibilities or setting a good example for my sister. In my final year, I plan to strengthen the club further by setting up a club email, creating a legit ON page, and potentially collaborating with other clubs.</p>
