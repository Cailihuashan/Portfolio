                <h3>This section reflects on how I demonstrate moral character at Greenwood through honesty, responsibility, and thoughtful decision-making.</h3>
                <p>I strive to be truthful and honest with both my teachers and peers. I respect them and believe they deserve to be informed, which is why I usually don't hide anything. That said, I acknowledge that complete honesty in every situation is complicated. There are rare moments when I might choose to hide the full truth if I believe it would avoid unnecessary harm or benefit everyone involved. I try to make these decisions thoughtfully by considering the consequences of what I say. While I understand that no one can be perfectly truthful all the time, I do my best to balance honesty with empathy and good judgment.</p>
                <p>When it comes to taking responsibility for my actions, I believe in being accountable, but only when it is certain that everyone knows that I did it. In situations where it's clear that people know I made a mistake, I take ownership and accept the consequences. However, even in cases where no one is aware, I still make the effort to fix the issue privately. I do this not just to avoid guilt but also to protect my own sense of integrity and self-respect. This approach helps me continue to grow as a responsible individual and encourages me to consistently reflect on my actions. Some people might view this as bad, but according to my humble observation in the nature of humans, I believe that this action is justified by our nature.</p>

                <p>I remember a few years ago, I had a friend. He asked for my opinion on something that he did during a party that he attended, which he thought was perfection. However, the spectators see the chess game better than the players, instead of agreeing to him, I pointed out how his actions might be hurtful to some of the other participants and gave him advice on how he could make things better if in the same scenario next time.</p>
